Key features:

1. Easy shortcut creation: WebApps Creator simplifies the process of converting your web applications into desktop shortcuts. You just need to provide the URL of your website and configure some additional options, such as the application name, icon, category, and execution preferences.

2. Icon customization: You can choose from a wide variety of predefined icons or even upload your own images to represent your web applications. This allows you to customize and give a unique touch to each desktop shortcut you create.

3. Improved organization and accessibility: By creating .desktop shortcuts, you can organize your favorite web applications more efficiently on your desktop or application menu. This makes it easier to quickly access your preferred websites without having to open the browser and search for them manually, and you can also use an integrated browser that allows you to not rely on using a browser like Google Chrome, Opera, or another, making it feel like you're in an app and not on a web page.
